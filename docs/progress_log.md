## 2025-09-18 – Phase 1 Architecture Blueprint
Documented the client module graph, multiplayer touch points, and server-side world responsibilities that the single-player build must re-create, establishing the blueprint for the conversion effort.【F:docs/phase1_architecture.md†L1-L55】

## 2025-09-19 – Phase 2 Local Simulation Kickoff
Introduced a single-player toggle, `LocalGameClient` adapter, and an embedded world simulation so the existing game loop can run without WebSockets while preserving the current UI and systems.【F:client/js/app.js†L1-L120】【F:client/js/game.js†L1-L200】【F:client/js/singleplayer/localgameclient.js†L1-L109】【F:client/js/singleplayer/world.js†L1-L220】

## 2025-09-20 – Phase 2 Local Simulation Iteration
Expanded the local world simulator with timed mob AI, hero regeneration, multi-item loot handling, and chest respawns to mirror online server behavior more closely.【F:client/js/singleplayer/world.js†L318-L520】【F:client/js/singleplayer/world.js†L596-L736】
